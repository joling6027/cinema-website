# cinema-website

## Introduction

VisionShow is a static cinema website using HTML5/CSS/JavaScript.
It mimics an popular Canadian cinema - [Cineplex](https://www.cineplex.com/) 
This is the first project I implemented while I was new to web developing.
I'm currently working on transferring it to React. For now please click the link below to see how it works.
